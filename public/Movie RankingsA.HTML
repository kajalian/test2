<h1>Greatest Paintings of All Time (according to me but I am objectively correct)</h1>
<h2>My Top Three (to begin with)</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Da Vinci's <i>Madonna of the Rocks,</i> 1483-1486</h3>
<p>Much easier to see then the Mona Lisa, exhibits Da Vinci's ability to use composition and value to great effect and even takes advantage of a shaped canvas.<br/>
This work cannot be said to be allegorical in the modern sense, even though we individually might view it that way, because of our secularist popular culture and the continuing modern fragmentation of the Art world</p>

<h3>Andrew Wyeth's <i>Day Dream,</i> 1980</h3>
<p>Already of of the masters of American representation painting, <i>Day Dream</i> exhibits Wyeth's mastery of depicting space, as well as his skill as an allegorical painter.</p>
<p>A female figure lies sleeping on a bed in the sunlit upper level of a house- likely an attic- covered by a transparent shroud.<br/>
She is separate from us (the viewer) in three ways:<br/> 
    Temporally, as this painting is over forty years old;<br/>
    by the nature of being a piece of art and resting, physically, within a frame and behind glass;<br/>
    and by being remanded to the world of dreams, which we as waking persons are not privy to.<br/></p>

<h3>Goya's <i>Los Caprichos,</i> 1797-1798</h3>
<p>Neither a painting nor a singular work, Francisco Goya's <i>Los Caprichos</i> is one of the premier works of printmaking in European history.<br>
While he brings his painterly sensibilities to his use of composition, he demostrates a printmaker's and storytellers sense of narration- having used intaglio and its' closeness to drawing, as well as its' potential for the production of multiples-
to push the medium of intaglio printing past that of Durer, even; He relied heavily on aquatint, which was rudimentary at that time, to stunning effect.</p>
